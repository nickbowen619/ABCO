# ABCO
website for my dad to share his guitars that he sells.
My dad is a freelance guitar builder out of San Diego and recently made me the most beautiful guitar i've ever owned so I figured as a good start to get into web dev.
while I teach myself I would help give him a gallery, contact, and landing page so he can cleanly show off his work instead of just using instagram as a promo.
